# mastercomfig

This config is by default for modern PCs and aims to disable heavily unoptimized
features and adjust other settings where it does not affect behavior or visuals
noticeably. However, the config is documented extensively and also has presets
so that you may adjust settings to your needs/preferences.

You may find that this config makes TF2 a lot smoother, eliminates stuttering,
reduces load times and increases FPS. This is because this config is heavily
tuned and the commands and values are based on TF2's source code, rather than
just experiments, guesswork and trying to understand the vague/non-existent
documentation.

The config is constantly updated with tweaks, new features and documentation
improvements â€” iterated upon based on user feedback and benchmarks. So if you
think there's an unoptimal value, or if it's just as simple as a comment being
confusing to you, report the problem and you'll most likely see a fix in a
future update.

## Installation

### 1. Clean your TF2 install

To make sure there are no user settings that conflict with the config, you will
have to [clean up](#clean-up) your TF2 install.

### 2. Download and install your preset and addons

[Download](https://mastercoms.github.io/mastercomfig/download) the VPK files of your choice from the
and then drag them **directly** to your `tf/custom` folder. Do not put the VPKs
in a folder inside your `custom` folder, put them in the `custom` folder itself.
You don't have to rename anything either, just drag the files as is into `custom`.
Do not download the source code, and do not download from the `Clone or Download`
button. Only download the VPK files from the
[official site](https://mastercoms.github.io/mastercomfig/download).

The VPK includes everything needed for the config to run, so you don't need to
have an autoexec or run it using anything. If you already have an autoexec,
you'll definitely want to read step 4 for more information on how to migrate
to mastercomfig. **Don't edit the VPK either, step 4 has customization instructions.**

To get to `tf/custom`, right click Team Fortress 2 in your Steam library, click
**Properties**, go to the **Local Files** tab, and then click the
**Browse Local Files...** button. Then in the files app that appears, open the
`tf` folder and then open the `custom` folder.

### 3. Set Launch Options

Right click Team Fortress 2 in your Steam library, click **Properties** and
click the **Set Launch Options...** button. In the window that appears, remove
anything that's in there and paste
`-novid -nojoy -nosteamcontroller -softparticlesdefaultoff -reuse` into
the box and click ok.

You will also want to read about optional launch options and choosing a DirectX version [here](https://github.com/mastercoms/mastercomfig/wiki/Launch-Options).

### 4. Custom configs

You can't use an `autoexec.cfg` with mastercomfig. Instead, you will have to use `custom.cfg`.

So, if you already have an `autoexec.cfg`, just rename it to `custom.cfg`. Make sure you don't have a pre-existing
full blown config like Comanglia's or Chris' config or some network config in your `autoexec.cfg`, as that will
conflict with mastercomfig.

If you don't have an `autoexec.cfg`, you can create a `custom.cfg` in your `tf/cfg` folder to override any settings in the config.

If you have any class configs, you will have to rename them to add a `_c`.  (`scout_c.cfg`, `soldier_c.cfg`,
`pyro_c.cfg`, `demoman_c.cfg`, `heavyweapons_c.cfg`, `engineer_c.cfg`, `medic_c.cfg`, `sniper_c.cfg` and `spy_c.cfg`).
You can change the name of your custom class configs using the `class_config_classname` alias.
For example, you can put `alias class_config_heavyweapons "exec myheavy"` in `custom.cfg` if you want to use a file named `myheavy.cfg` for Heavy.

If there's something you'd like to run for all of your class configs, you can add it to `game_overrides_c.cfg`.
You can change the name of your custom game overrides config using the `game_overrides_c` alias.
For example, you can put `alias game_overrides_c "exec mygameoverrides"` in `custom.cfg` if you want to use a file named `mygameoverrides.cfg`.

If you have a `listenserver.cfg`, you will have to rename it to `listenserver_c.cfg`.
You can change the name of your custom listen server config using the `listenserver_c` alias.
For example, you can put `alias listenserver_c "exec mylistenserver"` in `custom.cfg` if you want to use a file named `mylistenserver.cfg`.

You can also get creative and use the aforementioned aliases to change your class config on the fly using binds or the console.
For example, you could have different class configs for Scout in competitive and casual and then change your `class_config_scout` alias to run your preferred class config when you want.

To easily customize settings, you can use [modules](https://github.com/mastercoms/mastercomfig/wiki/Modules).

To do finer customization through individual console variables and commands,
you can look through the [config file on GitHub](https://github.com/mastercoms/mastercomfig/blob/release/config/mastercomfig/cfg/comfig.cfg) and add your preferences to your `custom.cfg`.

It is also recommended to determine your optimal upload rate settings with [this tool](https://mastercoms.github.io/mastercomfig/upload).

To get an idea of how to use custom configs, [see what](https://github.com/mastercoms/mastercomfig/wiki/List-of-custom-configs) other people in the community have done.

### 6. Operating system optimizations
Although not strictly TF2 related, you can improve your performance at the OS
level: [Windows](https://github.com/mastercoms/mastercomfig/wiki/Windows-Systems),
[Linux](https://github.com/mastercoms/mastercomfig/wiki/Linux-Systems)

## Updating

When a new release comes out, check out the
[latest release](https://github.com/mastercoms/mastercomfig/releases/latest) and
then download the latest files and drag them into your `tf/custom` folder,
replacing the old files.

This config gets updates frequently, so to get the latest improvements, make
sure you check here for new releases frequently, or you can get notifications
about updates on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/CuPb2zV),
[Steam Group](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/comfig) or
[teamfortress.tv thread](http://www.teamfortress.tv/42867/mastercomfig-fps-customization-config).

## Clean up

**NOTE: This will reset ALL settings. Make sure you back up your binds and other
custom settings before you do this.**

If you have already have a config, or want to remove mastercomfig, delete any
configs you may have in `tf/custom` and delete the `tf/cfg` folder.
Then [verify your game files](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335)
using Steam.

Next, if you have Steam Cloud Synchronization enabled, make all the files in
`STEAM_FOLDER/userdata/USER_ID/440/remote/cfg` blank. Do not delete them, or
else Steam Cloud will redownload them. Alternatively, you can
[disable Steam Cloud](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=6736-QEIG-8941#enabling).

Finally, launch TF2 with only the
`-novid -default -autoconfig +host_writeconfig +mat_savechanges +quit` launch
options. The game will launch and exit. Afterwards, remove these launch options.
