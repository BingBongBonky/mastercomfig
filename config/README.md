# Config folder
This folder contains the original files for the config, used for creating the
VPK files. You can read the files in these folders for reference
but it is not recommended to use the `comfig.cfg` as an `autoexec` by copying
and pasting text, as you will lose the many benefits from the extra script and
data files in the config.

### low
